                              <strong>The Julio Prestes Cultural Center - Sala Sao Paulo</strong>
                              <br />
                              The cultural center is located in the Julio Prestes Train Station in the old north central section of the city. The old station is rebuilt to an amazing convert hall. This is a special place for classical music and architecture lovers. The acoustics of the place is stunning. Please check their event calendar before you visit and reserve a seat to enjoy a magical concert. If your schedule does not match, it is even fantastic for a simple visit without a concert.

                              This neo-gothic style cathedral began in 1913 and ended four decades later. It is now the largest church in Sao Paulo and considered by some to be the 4th largest neo-gothic cathedral in the world.

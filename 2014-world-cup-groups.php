            <h2>Group A</h2>
            <h3> Brazil, Croatia, Mexico, Cameroon</h3>
            <span>
                <img src="img/flags/brazil.png" alt="Brazil">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/croatia.png" alt="croatia">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/mex.png" alt="mex">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/cam.png" alt="cam">
            </span>

            <p>
                Cameroon making their 7th World Cup appearance, led by their electric striker Samuel Eto'o aim to make it out of the Round Robin. It won’t be an easy task, but even just making the World Cup was an accomplishment so they have little pressure and would like to become the 2014 World Cup’s underdog story. Making the group even harder for Mexico is the recent loss of star midfielder Juan Carlos Medina to an ankle injury. They will have a tough road to the next round. All of the pressure is on the host nation, Brazil, in this year’s World Cup. Croatia is looking as strong as ever heading into the World Cup, and they look to finish no lower than 2nd in the group
            </p>
            
            <h2>Group B</h2>
            <h3> Spain, Netherlands, Chile, Australia </h3>
            <span>
                <img src="img/flags/spain.png" alt="spain">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/neth.png" alt="neth">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/chile.png" alt="chile">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/aus.png" alt="aus">
            </span>

            <p>
                Chile has an even more difficult task having just lost midfielder Matias Fernandez to a severe ankle injury. Feeling the heat of a star-studded group, Australia is looking for a solid showing out of their young guns as they continue to prepare for the future. Spain: Spain is looking to repeat as champions at this year’s World Cup. With an all-star packed lineup, they want nothing less than a championship. Netherlands: With a new coach, Louis van Gaal, at the helm and a load of fresh young players. They are looking to bounce back from their draw in their first friendly against Ecuador this year.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Group C</h2>
            <h3> Columbia, Greece, Cote D’Ivoire, Japan </h3>
            <span>
                <img src="img/flags/col.png" alt="col">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/gre.png" alt="gre">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/ivory.png" alt="ivory">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/japan.png" alt="japan">
            </span>

            <p>
                In a relatively weak group, both Japan and Greece are looking to just make it through the group stage. Ivory Coast is coming into the World Cup with its hopes pinned on an experienced group. They’ve got a relatively easy road out of the group stage and are looking to put the pedal to the floor. For the 1st time in 16 years, Columbia is in the World Cup and after an impressive qualifying group win, they are looking to keep up the momentum and improve on their previous best performance and make it out of the group stage.
            </p>

            <h2>Group D</h2>
            <h3> Uruguay, Costa Rica, England, Italy </h3>
            <span>
                <img src="img/flags/urug.png" alt="urug">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/cr.png" alt="cr">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/eng.png" alt="eng">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/italy.png" alt="italy">
            </span>

            <p>
                Uruguay is coming into the World Cup with a nearly identical roster from 2010, Costa Rica has a brutal draw at this years’ World Cup, but with a group of rising young stars, they are looking to play the spoiler role this year. A lot of pressure is on the England team who hasn’t won the World Cup since 1966. With some new faces on the team this year, their chemistry may be a problem, especially in such a stacked group. Having last won in 2006, the Italians are looking to improve on their poor 2010 showing, not even making it out of the group stage. The team has been surrounded in controversy this year, after adding many new faces and neglecting older stars. They face a difficult task, but are eager to begin.
            </p>

            <h2>Group E</h2>
            <h3> Switzerland, Ecuador, France, Honduras </h3>
            <span>
                <img src="img/flags/switz.png" alt="switz">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/ecu.png" alt="ecu">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/fra.png" alt="fra">&nbsp;<img src="img/flags/hon.png" alt="hon">
            </span>

            <p>
                Switzerland is looking to make a splash at this years’ World Cup. Coming in with a new-look younger roster, the Swiss are hoping their youth can trump the experience of the rest of the nations in their group. Ecuador is coming into the World Cup with low expectations. Being one of the weaker squads at this years’ World Cup, there’s not much pressure on their squad, and they are looking to surprise their opponents. France, boasting a strong, experienced club is looking to easily advance through the group stage. If they can maintain their focus on the matches and disregard the off-pitch drama going on, they will be early favourites to win the group. The Hondurans are looking to win their first World Cup match in history. With a team that is more than capable of shocking its’ opponent, their inconsistency is a major question at this years’ World Cup.
